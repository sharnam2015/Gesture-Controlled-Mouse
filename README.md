# Gesture-Controlled-Mouse
A mini project where I built a simple gesture controlled mouse using the Laptop webcam
The mouse arrow on the Laptop will follow the motion of the Red tag. It can also click, open files and folders. 
To click and open files a gesture of pushing towards the Laptop can be made or we can stop and wait at the file for 
a few seconds. I used the RGB colours as tags, the Laptop webcam for images and MATLAB for image processing.
